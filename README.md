# ALX Low Level Programming
This course introduced me to `C programming` and helped me grow to the point where I agreed that ***`C` is fun***

The repository holds most of the `C` projects that I did while training to become a fullstack software engineer in the fully funded ALX SWE program.
The table below gives a brief summary of all the projects; you may click on any of them to see the content of the particular project.

Project Title | Brief Description
---- | ----
[C - Hello World](./0x00-hello_world) | This put to test my knowledge of `c compilation` stages and processes, `bash scripting`, and `environment variables`. Here, I learned how to use certain operators (such as `sizeof`) and standard library functions (such as; `printf`, `puts` & `putchar`) in `c`. *And more...*
[C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | The project gave me an understanding of `datatypes`, `variables`, conditional statements and `while loop` in `c`. I also learned about arithematic, logical, relational and boolen operators; I experienced the use of `ASCII` values as well
[C - Functions, Nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) | Here, I learned how to use nested loops, the scope of variables, header files, prototypes, function declaration and function definition in `c`
[C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging) | The project was about how to read errors and manually get bugs out of the codes
[C - More functions, Nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | All about writing some user define functions, saving the prototypes in the `main.h` file and testing them in some `main.c` files
[C - Pointers arrays strings - 0](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | About `pointers`, `arrays`, `strings` and how to manipulate them
[C - Pointers arrays strings - 1](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) | Here, I was made to write more `user defined functions` and to emulate some standard library functions defined in `strings.h`
[C - Pointers arrays strings - 2](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) | This was about `pointers to pointers`, `multidimensional arrays`, and emulating common standard library functions used to manipulate strings
[C - Recursion](./0x08-recursion) | About `recursive functions` in `c`, how to use them, when to use them, and when not to use them
[C - Static libraries](./0x09-static_libraries) | The meaning, function, making and usage of static libraries in `c`; understanding what `ar`, `ranlib` and `nm` do and how they are used
[C - argc argv](./0x0A-argc_argv) | The project was about writing programs that arguments could be passed to on the command line while running them.
[C - Malloc, free](./0x0B-malloc_free) | About dynamic *memory allocation* (`malloc`) and `free`ing the dynamically allocated memory, and how to check for memory leaks with `valgrind`
[C - More malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free) | This project introduced the `exit`, `calloc`, `realloc` (standard library) functions and how they are used
[C - Preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor) | About common predefined and user defined `macros` and how to use them; and the essence of `include guard` in header files
[C - Structures, typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef) | The project was about using `struct` and `typedef` to create a data structure and non-existing datatype that is made up of some primitive datatypes. If you wish to learn about struct, I simplified it [here](https://github.com/tpauldike/journey_through_C/blob/main/7-struct_typedef/README.md)
[C - Function pointers](./0x0F-function_pointers) | About pointers that hold the address of funtions and serve as access points of the functions
[C - Variadic functions](./0x10-variadic_functions) | Writing `c` functions that take variable number of arguments each time they're called; knowing the use of `va_arg`, `va_start`, `va_end` and `const`
[C - Singly linked list](./0x12-singly_linked_lists) | About linking up nodes which take the form of *structs that are connected to one another in an orderly manner, following convention*
[C - More singly linked list](./0x13-more_singly_linked_lists) | How to use singly linked list
[C - Bit manipulation](./0x14-bit_manipulation) | How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
[C - File I/O](./0x15-file_io) | About how to use system calls, such as; `open`, `close`, `read` and `write` to interact with the kernel and how to use the flags â€” `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`
[C - Doubly linked list](./0x17-doubly_linked_lists) | A more complex form of singly linked list
[C - Dynamic libraries](./0x18-dynamic_libraries) | The meaning, function, making and usage of static libraries in `c`; understanding what `nm`, `ldd` and `ldconfig` do and how they are used; knowing the use of the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it
[C - Hash tables](./0x1A-hash_tables) | About `hash functions` and `hash tables`, what collisions are and the common ways to handle them
[C - Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles) | Writing own **Makefile** and running it with the `make` utility on a Linux machine
