# ALX Low Level Programming
This course introduced me to `C programming` and helped me grow to the point where I agreed that ***`C` is fun***

The repository holds most of the `C` projects that I did while training to become a fullstack software engineer in the fully funded ALX SWE program.
The table below gives a brief summary of all the projects, you may click on any of the directories to see the content of the particular project.

Project Title | Brief Description
---- | ----
[C - Hello World](./0x00-hello_world) | This put to test my knowledge of `c compilation` stages and processes, `bash scripting`, and `environment variables`
[Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | The project gave me an understanding of `datatypes`, `variables`, and conditional statements in `c`
