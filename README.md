# ALX Low Level Programming
This course introduced me to `C programming` and helped me grow to the point where I agreed that ***`C` is fun***

The repository holds most of the `C` projects that I did while training to become a fullstack software engineer in the fully funded ALX SWE program.
The table below gives a brief summary of all the projects; you may click on any of them to see the content of the particular project.

Project Title | Brief Description
---- | ----
[C - Hello World](./0x00-hello_world) | This put to test my knowledge of `c compilation` stages and processes, `bash scripting`, and `environment variables`. Here, I learned how to use certain operators (such as `sizeof`) and standard library functions (such as; `printf`, `puts` & `putchar`) in `c`. *And more...*
[C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | The project gave me an understanding of `datatypes`, `variables`, conditional statements and `while loop` in `c`. I also learned about arithematic, logical, relational and boolen operators; I experienced the use of `ASCII` values as well
[C - Functions, Nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) | Here, I learned how to use nested loops, the scope of variables, header files, prototypes, function declaration and function definition in `c`
[C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging) | The project was about how to read errors and manually get bugs out of the codes
[C - More functions, Nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | All about writing some user define functions, saving the prototypes in the `main.h` file and testing them in some `main.c` files
[C - Pointers arrays strings - 0](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | About `pointers`, `arrays`, `strings` and how to manipulate them
[C - Pointers arrays strings - 1](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) | Here, I was made to write more `user defined functions` and to emulate some standard library functions defined in `strings.h`
[C - Pointers arrays strings - 2](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) | This was about `pointers to pointers`, multidimensional arrays, and emulating common standard library functions used to manipulate strings
