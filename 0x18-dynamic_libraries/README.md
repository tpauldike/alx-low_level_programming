# C - Dynamic libraries
The project taught me what dynamic libraries in `c` means, how it works, how I can create mine, and how it is used.
In the course of this project, I understood what `nm`, `ldd` and `ldconfig` do and how they are used
and I got to know the use of the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
