# C - Preprocessor
The compilation of `c` source codes to produce executables is a proceas that goes through four (4) stages:
1. Preprocessing
2. Compilation
3. Assembly
4. Linking

This project revealed to me certain things that happens in the very first stage.
The project made me learn about preprocessor directives in `c`, some common predefined macros and how they are used, the essence of include guard (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) in header files, and how to define my own macros and function-like macros.
