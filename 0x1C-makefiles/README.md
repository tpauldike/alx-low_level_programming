# C Makefiles
This project made me to understand what `make` is on a Linux machine and what `Makefile` is as well.
In this project I wrote, in an increasing order of complexity, my own Makefiles, that contain rules defined for `C` programming.
I also had to go through some Technical interview preparation, written in `python`

At this point in my life, I could excitedly say ***`C` is fun***
