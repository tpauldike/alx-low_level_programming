# C - Structures, typedef
A project that had me learning by doing.
It had tasks designed to help me master the pratical use of `struct` and `typedef` in `c programming`.

If you wish to learn about `struct` and `typedef`, I simplified it in a class and saved what we learned on Git, with a well organized readme [**here**](https://github.com/tpauldike/journey_through_C/blob/main/7-struct_typedef/README.md)
