0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This project was meant to further equip me with more skills in terms of the abilty to manipulate poiters, strings and arrays at will, with a proper and better understanding of how they work and how they are rightly and effectively used.
This project was done under the auspices of ALX Software Engineering Program in 2022.
